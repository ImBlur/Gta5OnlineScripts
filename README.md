# Grand Theft Auto 5 Online Scripts
This repo is dedicated to some GTA 5 Online scripts that I made.

### Python is required to run the scripts ONLY if you don't download a release!
### Make sure you have `python3` or above installed to BUILD the scripts!

#### These scripts have been made for `Windows`.

## Download:
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/ImBlur/Gta5OnlineScripts/total?label=Downloads)](https://github.com/ImBlur/Gta5OnlineScripts/releases)

You can download the latest release of the scripts from: https://github.com/ImBlur/Gta5OnlineScripts/releases

Download the `Gta5OnlineScripts.rar`.

Building is not required if you download the release.

## How to build the scripts:
Open a terminal and navigate to the scripts folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required python modules and then `python build.py` to build the scripts.

## Heist Replay Glitch
I recommend watching some YouTube videos about this before you run this script. (just search for: Gta online `name of the heist` replay glitch)
 When it tells you to disconnect your ethernet cable you press `N` on the keyboard and the script will automatically disable your internet connection without the need to disconnect the cable.

### Make sure you open the scripts and replace with your network interface name.
Go in `Network Connections` to check your interface name.

Open the `settings.cfg` file and repleace `Ethernet` with your currnet network interface name.

## Solo Public Session
You just open the script to create a solo public session. This script will automatically create a public session with nobody on it so you can safely sell your bunker/night club stocks without the constant fear of griefers coming to kill you.
