# Grand Theft Auto 5 Online Scripts
This repo is dedicated to some GTA 5 Online scripts that I made.
To run the scripts just open the `.bat` file.

### Make sure you have `python3` or above installed for the scripts to work correctly!

#### These scripts have been made for `Windows`.

## Heist Replay Glitch
I recommend watching some YouTube videos about this before you run this script. (just search for: Gta online `name of the heist` replay glitch)
 When it tells you to disconnect your ethernet cable you press `N` on the keyboard and the script will automatically disable your internet connection without the need to disconnect the cable.

### For this script to work you need the python module `keyboard` installed.
To get this module just press `Windows key` on your keyboard, search for `CMD` and open it as administrator.
In there you just type: `pip install keyboard`

### Make sure you open the scripts and replace with your network interface name.
Go in `Network Connections` to check your interface name.

Change `Ethernet` to your current network interface name.

## Solo Public Session
You just open the script to create a solo public session. This script will automatically create a public session with nobody on it so you can safely sell your bunker/night club stocks without the constant fear of griefers coming to kill.
